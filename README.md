## Project Overview

This project gains essential information about your favourite jelly bean flavours with Jelly Bean :tm: company milestones. This app is designed to demonstrate my ability to parse information from an API and display the data in reusable components. I have also added a simple filter allowing the user to filter the results by colour.
This project is a React application developed with TypeScript. It uses Tailwind CSS for styling, and itâ€™s set up to deploy automatically to GitHub Pages using a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Features

- Developed using React with TypeScript.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI design.
- Automatically deployed to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions.

## Reflection

**Why build this app?**
Having worked with api calls on a daily basis in my previous role as Frontend Dev at fern and being unable to display any of the functions as they are not open source, I built this app to demonstrate my ability working with APIs. Having other projects that purely gain information from an API, this project has an added filter so the user can filter the results by colour.

**What did I set out to build?**
This project was built to demonstrate that I can use an API to gather information and display it with an added filter to display user defined results. This app is focused on functionality with very basic UI.

**Was this project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience?**
The [Jelly Bean Wiki](https://jelly-belly-wiki.netlify.app/) API requires extra steps handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing which had not been something I'd covered in previous projects which provided valuable learning oppotunities.
